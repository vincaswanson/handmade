              <p>Handmade is a narrative nonfiction book on creativity, practice, and inspiration in this time of attention
                disorder. It argues for the value of doing things well, the need to work with our hands, and for using them
                to help us think and engage with the world.</p>
              <p>The book argues for the need for individuals, for cultures to remain creative, to stay curious, and to keep
                engaged with the physical world as a means of thinking more clearly.</p>

              <quote>"This is a book to inspire anyone who wants to do work that has meaning and purpose. It is also about becoming
                a creative, compassionate, and forgiving person through the pursuit of excellence in oneâ€™s chosen vocation;
                the journey to craft mastery becomes a journey of self-realization."
